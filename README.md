# Movies Library React/Node.js App
Web application for storing movie information. You can add movie from input fields form, upload movies information file and save it to DB. You can also delete it. All movies are in alphabetic order by default. You can see more information about each movie by clicking "More info" button. There are also two input fields, with movie search by title or by actors.

### Stack
React, React Router, SCSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose.
I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for client development.

### Run the app
1. **git clone** https://github.com/DenisKanivets/movies-library.git
2. Run **npm install** in main folder
3. Run **npm install** in client folder
4. Run **npm run dev** in main folder. It creates both environments - back-end and front-end (connects to MongoDB and starts create-react-app).
